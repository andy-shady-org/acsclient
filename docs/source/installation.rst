How to install ACSClient
========================

Until it gains more stability, the only way to install ACSClient is to install
it manually.

The way to build it locally::

    git clone https://github.com/nlgotz/acsclient.git
    python setup.py install

Future
------

ACSClient will eventually be added to PyPi and be installable via Pip.
